# SparkAISummit, London-2018
this repo will be my notes, learning, findings etc. from the event

## TODO
artical : "X takeaways from …" 
  - ml pipeline
  - spark ml
  - spark inside code - Higher-order functions, rank in dataset search 
  - spark devops - Lambda Architecture
research / note taking, beforehand on imp topics  
list speaker and their tech details  
google topic with speaker , if already had links  
focuse on spark - ml, technical deep dive
